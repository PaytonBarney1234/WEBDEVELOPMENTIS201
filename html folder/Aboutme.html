                        <p>During a fall practice last year, I unexpectedly found myself lying on the Utah Valley University baseball field.  I knew at that moment  I had torn the ligaments in my knee again. As the pain set in, I immediately contemplated what this meant for my future. Recovering from surgery, I spent a lot of time thinking about my next move. Part of me wanted to do another year of rehab to pursue my childhood dream of playing collegiate baseball. But after much prayer and conversations with family, friends, and mentors, I realized it was time to retire from baseball and begin a new phase of life by transferring to Brigham Young University.</p>
                        <p>Upon transferring, I became a member of the Real Estate Associations and the Private Equity & Market Associations. I attended the weekly meetings, eager to learn and receive advice. I also participated in the Real Estate Association’s case competition in valuing and underwriting a property. The case competition solidified my interest in specializing in corporate real estate.</p>
                        <p>The past year's experiences, both good and bad, have forced me to focus on what I want out of a career. I believe I am well suited for a career in corporate real estate and that this path will bring me personal fulfillment and growth. The Finance Program is the clear next step and best major as I pursue this career goal.</p>
